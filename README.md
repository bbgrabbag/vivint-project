# Vivint Project
## Stock Data Application Summary
- Allows users to enter a string of ticker symbols.
- A graph displays the daily high figures for each ticker symbol over the prevoius 3 month period.

## Design
- Core UX/UI functionalities were taken into consideration, such as error handling, loading status, and form validation. 
- A random hex color is generated for each symbol dynamically.
- Component methods were split up as much as possible to allow for reusability and extensibility as much as possible. All additional helper functions live in `/utils` folder.
